            <h4>Fort Hunter & Queen Anne's Chapel</h4>
            <p id="p1" name="p1">The 1711 construction of Queen Anne’s Chapel in Fort Hunter was intended to serve many goals for the Iroquois and New York colonial leaders who requested it, the British metropolitan officials who funded it, and the Iroquois and settler congregants who attended it.  Peter Schuyler, mayor of Albany, and the "Four Indian Kings" (actually three young Mohawks and a Mahican without real authority) traveled to London in 1710 to more firmly tie British imperial interests to the defense of New York and Native communities against French incursion.<label for="fn1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn1" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" data-step="6" data-intro="Short footnotes can be found in the sidebar.

            <p id="p2">After the construction of the chapel, services were held sporadically by ministers based in Schenectady and Albany, who recorded equally sporadic baptisms and marriages.<label for="fn3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn3" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">On Indian conversion in North America, see Hankins; Woolverton, 103; Greer, "Conversion and Identity"; Simmons; Axtell, "Were Indian Conversions Bona Fide"; Cohen; Morrison; Fisher, "Native Americans, Conversion, and Christian Practice"; Salisbury, "Embracing Ambiguity"; Andrews; Fisher, The Indian Great Awakening.<a class="badge badge-secondary" href="#fullnote-3">full note</a></span>  Henry Barclay, the son of one of these ministers, was appointed by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel as Catechist to Fort Hunter in 1735 and began keeping a regular "Register of Baptisms, Marriages, Communicants and Funerals at Fort Hunter" recording the names of children baptized, their parents, godparents, witnesses and sponsors.<label for="fn4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn4" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">Henry Barclay, <a href="http://nyheritage.nnyln.org/digital/collection/p16124coll1/id/45331/">Register of Baptisms</a>; Sivertsen, 125; Hopkins, 27; Lydekker, 53-54.  On early Anglican practices of register keeping, see Spragge. <a class="badge badge-secondary" href="#fullnote-4">full note</a></span>  The practice of godparentage, baptismal sponsorship, and baptismal witnessing documented fictive kinship ties between natal families which sometimes, but not often, crossed ethnic and racial lines.<label for="fn5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn5" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">On the practice of godparentage and baptismal sponsorship broadly in the early modern period, see Holifield, 53–55; Mintz and Wolf; Bennett; and Smith, "Child-Naming Practices," 13; Wolf, 293-294; Smith, "Child-Naming Patterns," 76;  Clark and Gould; Goetz; Tebbenhoff; Spangler; Coster; Lindmark. <a class="badge badge-secondary" href="#fullnote-5">full note</a></span>  For example, in early 1734 when William and Mary Sixbury presented their child Cornelius for baptism, Cornelius was sponsored by John Hough and Mary Phillips.  Later that same year, when William Sixbury and John and Susan Bowen sponsored the infant son of William and Cornelia Bowen, the adults reinforced natal ties between brothers John and William Bowen, ties across natal families between their wives, and ties of friendship or more distant relation with William Sixbury.</p>
            <p id="p3">The communities surrounding Fort Hunter which attended service and baptized their children at Queen Anne’s Chapel were mixed and varied, and practiced baptism and sponsorship in different ways.  The Mohawk community of Tiononderoge, where most of the Iroquois Fort Hunter congregants lived, had a long history of mixed material culture in which European goods were used and reworked to fit indigenous contexts, as well as a hybrid practice of Christianity which blended indigenous, Catholic, and Protestant elements.<label for="fn6" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn6" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">On Mohawk material culture, see Moody and Fisher, 8; MacLeitch, 175-210; Preston, 178-215; Jordan, 264 and 342.

            <h4>All One People</h4>
            <p id="p4">In this mixed landscape, people from two Native nations with very different relations to settler communities, European ethnic groups at odds with one another, and enslaved Africans all attended church and had their children baptized at Queen Anne's Chapel.  The network of relations documented by these baptisms made visible the ways in which ethnic and racial boundaries were made, maintained, and occasionally crossed.  The prominence of a Dutch woman as an intercultural go-between, as well as Iroquois women's roles as connectors in the context of baptismal sponsorships suggests that in Iroquoia, women played a role in defining the social borders of their communities in ways elided by the model of male intercultural brokers or Native women's fur trade intermarriages.<label for="fn13" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn13" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">Sleeper-Smith; Mitchell; Morrissey, "Kaskaskia Social Network."  For an examination of the importance of nation, ethnicity, and indigenous political power to Native women's intermarriage, see DuVal.  For one case of a female diplomatic broker in eighteenth century Iroquoia, see Parmenter, "Isabel Montour"; and Hirsch. <a class="badge badge-secondary" href="#fullnote-13">full note</a></span>  Unlike the creation of marital kinship ties as in the Great Lakes and midcontinent, these fictive kinship ties of godparentage within the context of Anglican baptism mirrored Iroquois creation of fictive kinship ties through adoption and diplomatic metaphors<label for="fn14" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn14" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">Seeman; Macdougall, 31-32; Fur; Merritt, "Cultural Encounters"; Merritt, At the Crossroads, 51-59 passim. <a class="badge badge-secondary" href="#fullnote-14">full note</a></span> on the scale of the household rather than the nation.</p>
            <p id="p5">	The ethnic and national boundaries within the Fort Hunter congregation are most visible in a modularity analysis of the network.  Modularity identifies subcommunities within a network which have dense connections within the subcommunity and more sparse connections outside the subcommunity.<label for="fn15" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn15" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">Because of the small size of this network, modularity was run in Gephi at resolution 2.  Weingart, "Networks Demystified"; Newman, "Modularity and Community Structure in Networks." <a class="badge badge-secondary" href="#fullnote-15">full note</a></span>  In the Fort Hunter network, modularity analysis detected three subcommunities in the Iroquois portion of the network, four subcommunities in the settler portion, and one mixed Native-settler subcommunity which bridged the larger Iroquois and settler portions of the network.  The largest division within the congregation as a whole was between the Iroquois and settler portions of the network, bridged only one settler family and a few Iroquois families, but even within those two halves of the congregation, divisions of ethnicity and affinity existed.</p>

By the 1730s, children in the Dutch-English subcommunity of the Fort Hunter congregation had as many as two godparents and four baptismal sponsors or witnesses, creating ties between as many as six adults at a time and contributing to the density of connections in this subcommunity.

            <p id="p7">The density of connections in other subcommunities reflects the extent of their integration with the Dutch-English subcommunities and their assimilation to Anglican baptismal practice.  European settlers in New York felt a "protestant responsibility" to offer and accept baptism from other denominations when their own ministers were distant or rarely visited far-flung communities.<label for="fn22" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn22" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">Lindmark, 7–31.</span>
  Barclay administered baptism to children of Europeans in the area who did not necessarily consider themselves Anglican even if they attended service and had their children baptized at Fort Hunter.

The Scots-Irish subcommunity, on the other hand, had a more typical degree of internal connections similar to the two bridging communities and the Iroquois subcommunities, but had few connections to the wider network.  The baptismal sponsorship practices of the Scots-Irish subcommunity aligned more closely with the Dutch-English subcommunity, and yet only a few individuals connected the two.</p>
            <p id="p8">The enslaved African community, though comparatively very small in relation to the rest of the network, offers an interesting counterpoint to the connections among and between the Native and white settler subcommunities.

Unlike the Native portion of the congregation, which shared very dense connections between Native people and relatively sparse connections with the settler portion of the congregation, all enslaved people in the Fort Hunter congregaation had ties with both enslaved African and white baptismal sponsors.  The enslaved Africans in the Fort Hunter congregation were thoroughly enmeshed in the white settler network despite dense ties between one another, whereas the Iroquois community shared kinship ties with the white community only along its borders.  Iroquois communities did have contact with and occasionally adopted African individuals in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, but those ties were made within the context of Iroquois practices rather than Anglican baptism.<label for="fn25" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn25" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">Hart, "For the Good of Our Souls"; Hart, "Black 'Go-Betweens'", 88-113; Dennis, Cultivating a Landscape of Peace.</span></p>
            <p id="p9">	The gendered connections between Africans and white sponsors at Fort Hunter underlines the importance of property ownership in sponsoring enslaved children, themselves property.  Although the most-connected African individuals were both women, Rachel Speck and Elizabeth Powel, their primary connections were with prominent white men.  Speck and Powel lacked documented direct connections with one another in this network, although members of their families sponsored one anothers' children, suggesting that although the two families shared relationships outside the documented baptismal ties.  Within the framework of Anglican baptism, however, the white household of residence was a more prominent organizing factor in the creation of baptismal ties.  White men were the primary sponsors for enslaved children, both within their own households and in others’.  Very few white women sponsored enslaved children, and those who did so were prominent property owners themselves.  Mary Phillipse and Anna Clement stood as godparents to enslaved children, at least once each to enslaved children outside of their households.  Mary Phillipse was among a small handful of white women who appeared on a Fort Hunter area tax list in the late 1760s, one of the more prominent property holders taxed at seventeen pounds and five day's public work--perhaps done by her slaves.<label for="fn26" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn26" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">Simms.  History of Schoharie County: 150. <a class="badge badge-secondary" href="#fullnote-26">full note</a></span>  Though not noted in the register or the tax lists as a slave owner, her prominence as a property owner at Fort Hunter suggests that, like white male godparents to enslaved children, Phillipse also owned the parents of children whose baptisms she witnessed.  Anna Clement, though less prominent as a property owner, operated a tavern with her husband Joseph.  Both white women's roles as godparents to enslaved children despite the broader pattern of white male godparentage to enslaved children suggests that property ownership or ownership of enslaved people was the primary factor white sponsorship of enslaved children.</p>

Herself illiterate and her husband Joseph barely literate, Anna Clement’s position in the Fort Hunter network complicates the picture of the male intercultural mediator.  Johnson's papers form part of what might be considered the "canon" of Iroquois studies and especially Iroquois intercultural diplomatic history, and Johnson painted the Clements as alternatively unimportant and subversive.  Johnson, who through his self-promotion efforts would become the British Superintendent for Indian Affairs in 1756, and Montour both appear as relatively uninfluential figures in this network as measured by their betweenness centrality.

            <p id="p12">The Iroquois portion of the congregation differed in significant ways from the settler portion of the congregation in the structure of its subcommunities, in the factors that separated its subcommunities, and the structural role of women.  The Iroquois portion of the congregation had a lower average density of connections like some subcommunities of the settler portion of the congregation, possibly reflecting a continuity of French Catholic sponsorship practices; Barclay and his predecessors noted that many adults at Tiononderoge were "baptised in Canada."<label for="fn37" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn37" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">On Catholic practices of godparentage in New France, see Poirier, Religion, Gender, and Kinship in Colonial New France, 175; Sleeper-Smith, 47; Morrissey, "Kaskaskia Social Network," 142. <a class="badge badge-secondary" href="#fullnote-37">full note</a></span>  Additionally, the network of ties between Iroquois individuals documented in the baptismal register is not complete because it necessarily recorded only religious ties of church members.

Iroquois clans spanned the Six Nations, with clan members from different nations considered kin descended from a common matrilineal female ancestor.

            <p id="p15">Because Iroquois baptismal sponsorship often created ties between members of different clans, Iroquois subcommunities were not divided along clan lines.  However, certain subcommunities were composed of different alignments of clans, suggesting that members of some Iroquois clans engaged differently with the nearby settler communities.  Historians have long argued that internal factionalism caused damage and decline in Iroquois military and political power,<label for="fn46" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn46" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">Aquila, The Iroquois Restoration, 75-77; Lehman, "The End of the Iroquois Mystique; Richter, "Iroquois versus Iroquois; Richter, "War and Culture"; Richter and Merrell.

For a critique of this approach, see Parmenter, "‘L’Arbre de Paix.’" <a class="badge badge-secondary" href="#fullnote-46">full note</a></span> but the alignment of subcommunities within the Fort Hunter congregation does not support this.  First, because the Iroquois subcommunities were relatively entangled, especially compared to the fractured settler portion of the congregation.  Second, because the alignments of the Iroquois subcommunities, at least as visible at Tiononderoge in the 1730s and 1740s, does not neatly align with the supposedly pro-French and pro-British politics which historians have argued drove Iroquois factionalism.  Rather, clan intermarriage and religious denomination were more salient factors in subcommunity formation.</p>
            <p id="p16">The two Iroquois subcommunities with direct connection to the Bridge community, the Canasteje-Oseragighte and Kaghtereni-Uttijagaroondi subcommunities, were mainly composed of individuals from the Turtle and Bear clans.  The Kaghtereni-Uttijagaroondi subcommunity also included a small cluster Wolf clan members, but these were separated by many degrees of connection from the bridge to the settler portion of the congregation.  The Kenderago-Canostens subcommunity was most distantly connected to the settler portion of the congregation, and was mainly composed of Wolf and Bear clan members.  This may reflect clan engagement with settler communities broadly.  William Johnson had a long-standing connection to the Mohawk Turtle clan through Molly and Joseph Brant's stepfather Brant Kanagaradunka,<label for="fn47" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn47" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">O’Toole, 105, 121-124, 172, 334, Sivertsen, 127-142, 163-171; Leavey, Molly Brant, 23. <a class="badge badge-secondary" href="#fullnote-47">full note</a></span> while the most prominent member of the Kenderago-Canostens subcommunity, Abraham Canostens Peterse, once accused William Johnson of disguising a plot in which the French and English conspired to kill all Mohawks.  The separation of the Kenderago-Canostens subcommunity may also have been denominational.  By 1751, Abraham was a lay preacher and appointed an Anglican Reader, as well as a noted follower of New Light preacher Jonathan Edwards sometimes at odds with the High Anglican aligned Barclay.<label for="fn48" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn48" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">SWJP, 9:52-54 and 62; DRCHNY, 6:589-590; Sivertsen 144-149.</span>  The relative distance of Wolf clan members from the settler portion of the congregation may reflect matrilineal clan approaches to engaging settler communities, religious divisions within the Iroquois community or differences with Barclay, or patterns of clan intermarriage.</p>
            <p id="p17">Women's clan affiliations in the Fort Hunter network are difficult to determine.  Most of the individuals in this network whose clans are known are men, because they appeared more frequently in recorded interactions with Europeans and European recording practices preferentially documented men's biographical details and patrilineages.  Many of the women do not appear in other archival records, or appear so rarely that it is difficult to build a concrete picture of their roles in their communities despite what is known of Iroquois women’s roles in governance and matrilineages.<label for="fn49" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn49" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">Kane, 89-144.</span>  Iroquois men additionally appear much more influential than Iroquois women as measured by their betweenness centrality in large part because the calculation of betweenness as measured throughout the network privileges those individuals who had a connection to the narrow bridge between the settler and Iroquois portions of the congregation.  By this measure, the most influential individuals in the network were Anna Clement and Esras Teganderasse, occasional preacher and schoolteacher, and son of Canasteje.</p>

Connections between all settler subcommunities were also almost all between men; a few settler women like Engeltie Hansen, Mary Quackenbus, and Cornelia Bowen had connections across subcommunities, perhaps as a result of intermarriage, but these were the exception.  Iroquois connections across all subcommunities were mainly heterogeneous, but women were the main connectors between subcommunities.  Men’s influence as measured by betweenness derived from their role as hubs of subcommunities, while women more often connected subcommunities or otherwise unconnected clusters within subcommunities.  Elizabeth Anoghsookte, Elizabeth Teganderasse, and Lydia Kaweghnoke all acted as anchors who connected the Bridge subcommunity to the main body of the Iroquois portion of the congregation, while Jacamine Kaghtereni, Margaret Oseragighte, Canasteje, Christina Brant’s wife, Catherine Kiliane’s wife, Catharine Tewajewasha, Margaret Kinsiago, Margaret Jughahise, Gesina Canostens, Ester Kenderago, and Mary Serehowane all connected the main subcommunities or smaller internal clusters.<label for="fn51" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn51" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">On Iroquois women's roles in their communities and the importance of matrilineages, see Mann, Iroquoian Women, 165-70; Brown, "Economic Organization and the Position of Women among the Iroquois"; Tooker, "Women in Iroquois Society"; Shoemaker, "The Rise or Fall of Iroquois Women," 303. <a class="badge badge-secondary" href="#fullnote-51">full note</a></span>  Iroquois men also connected subcommunities, but women much more frequently did so, suggesting that although the network was documented within the framework of Anglican baptismal sponsorship and kinship paradigms, the relationships it recorded reflected Iroquois matrilineal frameworks of kin and community.</p>

            <h4>And Under One King</h4>
            <p id="p20">As tensions escalated between Britain and France in the years leading to the Seven Years’ War, these divisions between settlers and Iroquois, and Iroquois perceptions of divisions between settler subcommunities, became ever more worrisome to British imperial officials.  In late 1756, a Dutch-heritage officer of the New York colonial militia went hunting with an Onondaga acquaintance, a fairly common interaction.  The Onondaga man’s knowledge of ethnic tensions within colonial New York proved unsettling enough for the officer to report to William Johnson.  "The Indian knowing him to be of Dutch extract, began to speak words reflecting on the English, and told Schuyler [the officer], it would be good that the Albany people or Dutch with the Indians should join and drive the English out of they country.  Schuyler says he was surprised to hear the fellow talk in that manner, and turning to him said, we are all one people and under one King."<label for="fn52" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn52" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">Sir William Johnson to the Earl of Loudon, "Information of an Onondaga Indian Called by the English Corn-Milk." Fort Johnson, March 4, 1757, Huntington Library, Loudon Papers, LO 2971.</span>  Colonel Thomas Butler commented darkly in 1757 "if any troubles should arise between the Six Nations and us, it will in great manner or entirely be owing to bad, ignorant people of a different extraction from the English, that makes themselves too buisy telling idle stories. I fear we have too many of those, who speak the indian tongue more or less, and don't consider the consequence of saying, we are Dutch and they are English."<label for="fn53" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn53" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">Ibid.</span>  Several schemes like Eleazar Wheelock’s Indian Charity School popped up in the 1740s and 1750s with hopes of finally converting the Iroquois to British interests,<label for="fn54" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn54" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">Many accounts of Wheelock’s efforts emphasize his Algonquian alumni, who left a large corpus of their own letters, but the majority of Wheelock’s students were always Iroquois and his funding from the Massachusetts General Assembly was contingent on enrolling Iroquois students.  Szasz, "‘Poor Richard Meets the Native American"; Fisher, The Indian Great Awakening;  Johnson, To Do Good to My Indian Brethren; Wyss, English Letters and Indian Literacies; Murray, "Pray Sir, Consider a Little";  Hoefnagel, Eleazar Wheelock and the Adventurous Founding of Dartmouth College;  Axtell, "Dr. Wheelock and the Iroquois"; Axtell, "Dr. Wheelock’s Little Red School." <a class="badge badge-secondary" href="#fullnote-54">full note</a></span> revealing British anxiety that the European residents of New York and the Iroquois were not, in fact, "all one people and under one King."</p>
            <p id="p21">Social network analysis of the Fort Hunter baptismal network complicates the picture of the male intercultural mediator, and suggests that Iroquois women used Anglican baptism to reinforce inter-clan connections.  Even within a single congregation, settler ethnic groups used the practice of baptismal sponsorship to define ethnic community boundaries, while the Iroquois portion of the congregation mediated their contact with the settler community through a sparsely documented Dutch woman, Anna Clement.  Clement’s prominence in the fictive kinship context of intercultural baptismal ties suggests that male go-betweens like Michael Montour and William Johnson who are documented through the archive of the diplomatic encounter were not the only intercultural mediators, and in fact may have been relatively uninfluential in the daily contact that produced fictive kinship ties of baptismal sponsorship.  Iroquois subcommunities fell along clan rather than ethnic lines, suggesting that even within a single national community like the Mohawk village of Tiononderoge, matrilineal clans approached engagement with settler communities with different goals.  Iroquois women acted as bridges between these subcommunities, suggesting that Mohawk and European women as well as men acted as mediators between communities.</p>
